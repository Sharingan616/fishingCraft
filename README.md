Fishing Craft
============

Part 1:
To make this work with Eclipse/MCP, you first need to have it all setup. (I'm assuming you know this since your here.)

Part 2: Then get the github repo files "assets", "common", "resources", and "shar". Put "assets", "common", and "shar" into a folder called "fishingcraft".

Note: This folder has to be the exact name or it won't work. If you don't feel like doing this, have fun editing each and every java file. :) I had to do that over 2 times.
